Ethnicity and routine childhood vaccinations in England (CPRD Aurum)

This repository contains the code lists and R code used to derive ethnicity and routine childhood vaccinations in England using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) Aurum database. 

Ethnicity files include:
- Ethnicity 2001 Census England & Wales (16 categories)
- Ethnicity 2011 Census England & Wales (18 categories)
- Ethnicity 2021 Census England & Wales (19 categories)
- R code for assigning each individual a single most plausible ethnic category using CPRD Aurum linked to HES Admitted Patient Care data

Routine childhood vaccination files include:
- MMR
- 6/5/4-in-1
- MenC & HibMenC
- MenB
- Rotavirus
- Pneumococcal
- R code for identifying vaccinations in the CPRD Aurum Observations and Drug Issue data tables, and deriving variables indicating whether the primary course and full course (primary + booster dose) had been completed by the expected birthday (first, second and fifth birthdays, as per the UKHSA/NHS Digital annual statistical reports)

The algorithms corresponding to these code lists and R code have been published in the supplemental appendix of XXX. Validation of completeness and representativeness are also contained within this paper.
